 *  @discussion Identities discovered via @c CKDiscoverAllUserIdentitiesOperation correspond to entries in the local Contacts database.  These identities will have @c contactIdentifiers filled out, which your app may use to get additional information about the contacts that were discovered.  Multiple @c contactIdentifiers may exist for a single discovered user, as multiple contacts may contain the same email addresses or phone numbers.
 *
 *  @return individual, non-unified contacts.
 *
 *  @discussion To transform these identifiers into an array of unified contact identifiers, pass a @c CNContact.predicateForContacts(withIdentifiers:) predicate into @c CNContactStore.unifiedContacts(matching:keysToFetch:)
